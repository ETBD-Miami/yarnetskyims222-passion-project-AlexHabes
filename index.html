                        <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>

                        <p>I am an independent artist with a great passion for music and the emotion it evokes. Some of my fondest memories are of listening to the weird tunes that my dad would play during long drives to our vacation spot in North Carolina. Music, in general, gives me such wonderful feelings of nostalgia, and I'm always excited to listen to various artists and dissect their creations. Some of my favorite genres include progressive rock, alternative rock, experimental rock, classic rock, pop music, psychedelic music, and classical music. I have also been heavily influenced by video game soundtracks. Being born with both perfect pitch and chromesthesia (which I'm very grateful for) has inspired me to make the most out of my ideas, and I hope this is reflected in my discography when you listen through it. Thank you, to anyone who listens to my music for even a second!</p>

                        <p>I would like to note that for my album "The Key to Color," most of the instruments you hear aren't actually being played. A lot of the music is straight from a computer software called MuseScore, which has been a very useful tool for me over the last couple of years. Credit goes to my brother John for helping with production (using Ableton Live 10 Suite) and my friend Halle Leroux for painting the album cover art. I hope to implement the usage of more real instruments for future projects (as soon as I can learn to play enough of them, of course). I am also open to any collaborations!</p>
